Put your company's (logo/latest product/cartoon mascot) in a 3D interactive facebook post. These are a quick way to get noticed, and come ready to post on your company's Facebook page in just a few short days!

Data Visualization

Big data, messy data, numbers written on the back of a napkin. Zinteger takes all types of data, and produces custom visuals that look EXACTLY like you want them. Not sure what to do with a dataset? Let us see what trends are hiding in your data. We love to work with small businesses that don't need to hire a full time data analyst, but still want to leverage data.
